# Tickly Project Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Tickly project based on the identified tasks and
requirements. The plan is organized by key areas of focus and includes rationale for each proposed change to ensure
alignment with project goals.

## 1. Security Enhancements

### Current State Assessment

The application has several security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, particularly in ticket validation and
user permissions. The lack of proper security measures exposes the application to potential attacks and unauthorized
access.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1.1 Authentication and Authorization

- **Fix ticket validation vulnerability**: Address the security issue in TicketServiceImpl.java (line 181) to prevent
  unauthorized ticket validation.
    - **Rationale**: This is a critical security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized users to validate tickets,
      compromising the integrity of the ticketing system.

- **Implement comprehensive permission checks**: Develop a robust permission system for all sensitive operations.
    - **Rationale**: A proper permission system ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized for,
      reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized operations.

- **Implement canValidateTicket method**: Add this method to TicketSecurityService to verify user permissions for ticket
  validation.
    - **Rationale**: This provides a centralized, reusable way to check ticket validation permissions, improving code
      maintainability and security consistency.

#### 1.2 Infrastructure Security

- **Implement HTTPS for all environments**: Ensure all data transmission is encrypted.
    - **Rationale**: HTTPS protects sensitive data during transmission, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and data
      interception.

- **Add security headers**: Implement X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Content Security Policy headers.
    - **Rationale**: These headers provide additional layers of protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS
      attacks and content type sniffing.

- **Configure proper CORS settings**: Restrict cross-origin requests to trusted domains only.
    - **Rationale**: Proper CORS configuration prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to our API, reducing
      the risk of CSRF attacks.

#### 1.3 Attack Prevention

- **Implement rate limiting for authentication**: Prevent brute force attacks on login endpoints.
    - **Rationale**: Rate limiting reduces the effectiveness of brute force attacks by limiting the number of login
      attempts within a specific timeframe.

- **Add API request throttling**: Prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
    - **Rationale**: Request throttling ensures the system remains available even under high load conditions, whether
      malicious or legitimate.

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

### Current State Assessment

The codebase has issues with organization, test coverage, and documentation that affect maintainability and reliability.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 2.1 Testing Strategy

- **Increase unit test coverage to 60%**: Focus on critical business logic components first.
    - **Rationale**: Higher test coverage ensures that code changes don't introduce regressions and helps document
      expected behavior.

- **Add integration tests for critical workflows**: Ensure end-to-end functionality works as expected.
    - **Rationale**: Integration tests verify that components work together correctly, catching issues that unit tests
      might miss.

- **Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline**: Ensure tests run automatically on code changes.
    - **Rationale**: Automated testing provides immediate feedback on code changes, preventing broken code from being
      deployed.

#### 2.2 Code Organization

- **Refactor large service classes**: Break down monolithic services into smaller, focused components.
    - **Rationale**: Smaller components are easier to understand, test, and maintain, reducing the cognitive load on
      developers.

- **Improve separation of concerns**: Ensure each component has a single responsibility.
    - **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more modular and easier to modify without
      unintended side effects.

- **Standardize exception handling**: Implement a consistent approach to error handling across the application.
    - **Rationale**: Consistent error handling improves debugging and provides a better user experience with predictable
      error responses.

#### 2.3 Documentation

- **Complete API documentation**: Add examples for all endpoints in the API.
    - **Rationale**: Comprehensive API documentation makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API
      correctly.

- **Add Javadoc for all public methods**: Ensure all public interfaces are well-documented.
    - **Rationale**: Method-level documentation helps developers understand the purpose and usage of each method without
      having to read the implementation.

- **Document database schema**: Create clear documentation of the database structure and relationships.
    - **Rationale**: Database documentation helps developers understand data flow and relationships, making it easier to
      write correct queries and prevent data integrity issues.

## 3. Resilience and Error Handling

### Current State Assessment

The application lacks robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, which can lead to poor user experience and system
instability during failures.

### Proposed Improvements

- **Enhance error handling with fallback mechanisms**: Implement graceful degradation for service failures.
    - **Rationale**: Proper fallback mechanisms ensure the application remains partially functional even when some
      components fail.

- **Implement consistent logging strategy**: Use appropriate log levels and structured logging.
    - **Rationale**: A good logging strategy makes troubleshooting easier and provides valuable insights into
      application behavior.

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### Current State Assessment

The user experience needs enhancement, particularly around error messages and security features.

### Proposed Improvements

- **Add password strength requirements**: Implement and validate password complexity.
    - **Rationale**: Strong passwords are essential for account security, and clear requirements help users create
      secure passwords.

- **Enhance error messages**: Make error messages more user-friendly and actionable.
    - **Rationale**: Clear error messages help users understand and resolve issues without requiring technical support.
