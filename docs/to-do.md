# Tickly Project Implementation Status Report

## Current Position in Task Plan

### Completed Tasks

#### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes

- [x] Fix ticket validation vulnerability (TicketServiceImpl.java line 181)
- [x] Implement canValidateTicket method in TicketSecurityService
- [x] Implement comprehensive permission checks for all sensitive operations

#### Phase 2: Code Quality Foundations

- [x] Standardize exception handling across the application
- [x] Implement consistent logging strategy with appropriate log levels
- [ ] Increase unit test coverage (partially completed)

### Current Progress

We have successfully completed Phase 1 (Critical Security Fixes) and made significant progress on Phase 2 (Code Quality
Foundations). Specifically:

1. **Security Improvements**:
    - Fixed the security vulnerability in ticket validation by implementing proper permission checks
    - Created the canValidateTicket method in TicketSecurityService to verify user permissions
    - Updated the PreAuthorize annotation in TicketController to use the new security method
    - Implemented comprehensive tests for the security components

2. **Code Quality Improvements**:
    - Standardized exception handling by:
        - Creating a BaseException class that all application exceptions extend
        - Implementing a consistent GlobalExceptionHandler for centralized error handling
        - Adding proper logging for all exceptions
    - Implemented a consistent logging strategy with:
        - Added LoggingUtils class for standardized logging
        - Added LoggingFilter to set up MDC context for each request
        - Added appropriate log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG) throughout the application
        - Added detailed logging in AuthController and AuthServiceImpl

## Remaining Tasks for Phase 2

To complete Phase 2 (Code Quality Foundations), the following tasks need to be addressed:

### 1. Increase Unit Test Coverage (Target: 60%)

#### Controllers to Test:

- [x] AuthController (completed)
- [x] TicketController (completed)
- [X] EventController (completed)
- [X] StructureController (completed)
- [X] UserController (completed)
- [X] TeamController
- [X] FriendshipController
- [X] StatisticsController

#### Services to Test:

- [x] AuthServiceImpl (completed)
- [x] TicketServiceImpl (completed)
- [X] EventServiceImpl
- [X] StructureServiceImpl
- [X] UserServiceImpl
- [X] TeamManagementServiceImpl
- [X] FriendshipServiceImpl
- [X] StatisticsServiceImpl
- [X] FileStorageServiceImpl
- [ ] MailingServiceImpl
- [ ] PdfServiceImpl
- [ ] TokenServiceImpl

### 2. Ensure Consistent Logging and Exception Handling

While we've implemented the framework for consistent logging and exception handling, we need to ensure it's applied
across all controllers and services:

- [ ] Review and update all controllers to use consistent logging patterns
- [ ] Review and update all services to use consistent logging patterns
- [ ] Ensure all custom exceptions extend BaseException
- [ ] Verify that all sensitive operations have appropriate error handling

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Prioritize by Domain**:
    - Continue with the domain-by-domain approach, focusing on one functional area at a time
    - Suggested order: Event domain, Structure domain, User domain, Team domain, etc.

2. **For Each Domain**:
    - Review controller for proper logging and exception handling
    - Review service implementations for proper logging and exception handling
    - Implement or improve tests for controllers and services
    - Verify test coverage meets the 60% target

3. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
    - Ensure security checks are properly tested
    - Use mocks for external dependencies
    - Include both positive and negative test cases

4. **Logging Best Practices**:
    - Use INFO level for normal operations
    - Use WARN level for potential issues
    - Use ERROR level for exceptions and failures
    - Use DEBUG level for detailed troubleshooting information
    - Include relevant context in log messages (user IDs, request IDs, etc.)

5. **Exception Handling Best Practices**:
    - Use specific exception types for different error conditions
    - Include helpful error messages
    - Log exceptions at appropriate levels
    - Return consistent error responses to clients

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress on the implementation plan, completing Phase 1 and making substantial progress on
Phase 2. The foundation for consistent logging and exception handling is in place, and we've started implementing
comprehensive tests.

To complete Phase 2, we need to continue applying these patterns across all controllers and services, and increase our
test coverage to meet the 60% target. By following the domain-by-domain approach and adhering to the best practices
outlined above, we can efficiently complete the remaining tasks.
