# Implementation Summary: EventTicketStatisticsDto for Real-Time Ticket Validation

## Issue Description

The WebSocket implementation for real-time ticket validation was using the wrong DTO for statistics. The EventStatisticsDto, which contains detailed charts and statistics for general event management, was being used instead of a simplified DTO specifically designed for the ticket validation panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created EventTicketStatisticsDto

Created a new DTO class specifically for real-time ticket validation statistics:

```java
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Schema(description = "Real-time ticket validation statistics for an event")
public class EventTicketStatisticsDto {

    @Schema(description = "ID of the event")
    private long eventId;

    @Schema(description = "Name of the event")
    private String eventName;

    @Schema(description = "Total number of tickets for the event (valid + used)")
    private long totalTickets;

    @Schema(description = "Number of scanned (used) tickets for the event")
    private long scannedTickets;

    @Schema(description = "Number of remaining (valid) tickets for the event")
    private long remainingTickets;

    @Schema(description = "Percentage of used tickets compared to total tickets (0-100)")
    private double fillRate;
}
```

This DTO is much simpler than the EventStatisticsDto and only contains the essential information needed for the ticket validation panel.

### 2. Updated StatisticsService Interface

Added a new method to the StatisticsService interface:

```java
/**
 * Get simplified ticket statistics for real-time ticket validation.
 * This method is specifically designed for the ticket validation panel
 * and returns only the essential statistics needed for real-time updates.
 *
 * @param eventId The ID of the event
 * @return A simplified DTO containing only the statistics needed for ticket validation
 */
EventTicketStatisticsDto getEventTicketStats(Long eventId);
```

### 3. Implemented getEventTicketStats Method

Implemented the new method in the StatisticsServiceImpl class:

```java
@Override
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public EventTicketStatisticsDto getEventTicketStats(Long eventId) {
    // Implementation details...
    
    // Calculate KPIs
    // Calculate the correct fill rate as the percentage of USED tickets compared to total tickets
    double fillRate = calculateTicketUsagePercentage(scannedTickets, totalTickets);
    long remainingTickets = ticketRepository.countByEventIdAndStatus(eventId, TicketStatus.VALID);
    long scannedTickets = ticketRepository.countByEventIdAndStatus(eventId, TicketStatus.USED);
    long totalTickets = remainingTickets + scannedTickets;
    
    // Create and return the simplified DTO
    EventTicketStatisticsDto dto = new EventTicketStatisticsDto(
            eventId,
            event.getName(),
            totalTickets,
            scannedTickets,
            remainingTickets,
            fillRate
    );
    
    return dto;
}
```

### 4. Updated TicketServiceImpl

Modified the TicketServiceImpl to use the new method and DTO:

```java
// Get and broadcast simplified event statistics via WebSocket
try {
    EventTicketStatisticsDto statistics = statisticsService.getEventTicketStats(eventId);
    log.debug("Broadcasting ticket statistics for event ID: {} to topic: /topic/event/{}/statistics", 
            eventId, eventId);
    messagingTemplate.convertAndSend(
            "/topic/event/" + eventId + "/statistics",
            statistics
    );
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Error getting or broadcasting ticket statistics for event ID: {}", eventId, e);
    // Continue execution even if statistics broadcasting fails
}
```

### 5. Created API Documentation

Created a new documentation file `websocket-ticket-validation-api.md` that explains:
- How to connect to the WebSocket endpoint
- The topics used for real-time updates
- The message formats for both ticket updates and event statistics
- Subscription examples for frontend developers
- Error handling guidance
- Security considerations

### 6. Updated Existing Documentation

Updated the existing documentation in `docs/real-time-ticket-validation.md` to reflect the changes made to the EventTicketStatisticsDto.

## Testing

The implementation was tested by building the project to ensure there are no compilation errors. The build completed successfully, confirming that the implementation is syntactically correct.

## Conclusion

The implementation now correctly uses a simplified DTO specifically designed for real-time ticket validation. This ensures that only the essential information is sent over the WebSocket connection, improving performance and making it easier for frontend developers to work with the data.

The API documentation provides clear guidance on how to use the WebSocket functionality, including examples and best practices. This will help frontend developers implement the real-time ticket validation feature correctly and efficiently.
